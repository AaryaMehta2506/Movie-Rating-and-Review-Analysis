# Movie Rating and Review Analysis using NLP

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We clean and analyze 50,000 movie reviews to understand viewer sentiment and generate insights through visualizations like word clouds and sentiment distribution charts.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze movie reviews and:
- Classify them as **positive** or **negative**
- Understand common words and themes using word clouds
- Explore sentiment distribution in the dataset

---

## 📁 Dataset

**Source**: [IMDb 50K Movie Reviews – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download)

- `review`: Text of the movie review  
- `sentiment`: Label – `positive` or `negative`

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data handling & visualization
- `nltk` – Text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming)
- `wordcloud` – Word visualization

---

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Lowercasing, removing HTML tags and punctuation
   - Removing stopwords and applying stemming

2. **Visualization**:
   - Word Clouds for positive and negative reviews
